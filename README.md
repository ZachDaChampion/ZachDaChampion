# Hi, I'm Zach
I'm a computer engineering student interested in robotics and embedded programming. I have experience in C, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

# Projects
I've separated my projects into a few categories. You can find more information about each project by clicking on the links below.

## [Web Dev](pages/web-dev.md)
Web development isn't my favorite thing to do, but I think it's an important skill to have. I've become fairly comfortable with web technologies, both frontend and backend, and I have a few projects that I'm proud of.

## [Robotics](pages/robotics.md)
In high school I participated in Vex Robotics. This is where I first learned C and C++. Most of my time in high school was spent in robotics, so I have quite a few projects from that time.
