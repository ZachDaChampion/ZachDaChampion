# Hi, I'm Zach
I'm a computer engineering student interested in robotics and embedded programming. I have experience in C, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

# Projects
Here are some highlights of what I've done.

## Rankr
A website for ranking TV episodes. This was my first project done with a modern web framework and I chose to learn Vue.
I primarily used this project to improve my design skills, focusing on making a good-looking site with natural animations.
